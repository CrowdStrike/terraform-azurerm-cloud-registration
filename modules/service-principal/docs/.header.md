## Introduction

This Terraform module creates and configures the necessary Azure service principal for CrowdStrike's cloud security services. It handles the registration of your Azure tenant with CrowdStrike and assigns the required Microsoft Graph API permissions to enable comprehensive security monitoring.

The module supports both standard Azure Commercial and Azure Government environments.
The module would create a new service principal in your tenant using CrowdStrike's multi-tenant application.
When using Azure Management Groups, this module can enable automatic discovery of all subscriptions within your tenant, simplifying deployment across large Azure environments.

## Prerequisites

Before using this module, ensure you have:

1. Azure credentials with Global Administrator or Application Administrator permissions
2. CrowdStrike Falcon API credentials with appropriate permissions
3. Azure CLI installed if using management group functionality

## Implementation Notes

This module performs several key actions:
- Registers your Azure tenant with CrowdStrike Horizon
- Creates a service principal in your tenant
- Assigns necessary Microsoft Graph API permissions for security monitoring
- Optionally configures management group access for subscription discovery

The service principal created requires specific Microsoft Graph permissions to collect security data effectively. These permissions are assigned automatically by the module.
