## Introduction

This Terraform module creates and configures the necessary Azure service principal for CrowdStrike's cloud security services. It creates a service principal in your Azure tenant using CrowdStrike's multi-tenant application and assigns the required Microsoft Graph API permissions to enable comprehensive security monitoring.

## Prerequisites

Before using this module, ensure you have:

1. Azure credentials with Global Administrator or Application Administrator permissions
2. CrowdStrike's multi-tenant application client ID
3. Sufficient permissions to create service principals and assign API permissions in Azure AD

## Implementation Notes

This module performs several key actions:
- Creates a service principal in your tenant using CrowdStrike's multi-tenant application
- Assigns necessary Microsoft Graph API permissions for security monitoring
- Provides an object ID that can be used with the asset inventory module

The service principal created requires specific Microsoft Graph permissions to collect security data effectively. By default, the module assigns the following permissions:
- Application.Read.All
- GroupMember.Read.All
- Policy.Read.All
- Reports.Read.All
- RoleManagement.Read.Directory
- User.Read.All

These permissions can be customized if needed by providing your own list of app role IDs.

## Integration with Asset Inventory

This module is designed to work seamlessly with the CrowdStrike Asset Inventory module. After creating the service principal, you can use its object ID to configure the asset inventory module, which will grant the necessary permissions to monitor your Azure resources at either subscription or management group level.
