## Introduction

This Terraform module configures Azure log ingestion for CrowdStrike's cloud security services. It sets up the necessary Event Hub resources and diagnostic settings to collect Azure Activity Logs and Entra ID logs for real-time visibility and security monitoring.

## Prerequisites

Before using this module, ensure you have:

1. Azure credentials with sufficient permissions to create Event Hub resources and configure diagnostic settings
2. A CrowdStrike service principal (can be created using the service-principal module)
3. A resource group where the Event Hub resources will be deployed
4. Subscription IDs or management group IDs to monitor

## Implementation Notes

This module performs several key actions:
- Creates Event Hub resources for collecting Azure Activity Logs and Entra ID logs
- Configures diagnostic settings to send logs to the Event Hubs
- Assigns necessary permissions for the CrowdStrike service principal to access the logs
- Optionally deploys a remediation policy to automatically configure diagnostic settings for new subscriptions

The module supports two main log types:
1. **Azure Activity Logs** - Administrative, security, service health, alert, recommendation, policy, autoscale, and resource health logs
2. **Entra ID Logs** - Audit logs, sign-in logs, non-interactive user sign-in logs, service principal sign-in logs, managed identity sign-in logs, and ADFS sign-in logs

## Flexibility Options

This module offers flexibility in deployment:
- Use existing Event Hub resources or create new ones
- Monitor specific subscriptions or entire management groups
- Enable or disable Activity Log and Entra ID log collection independently
- Customize resource naming with prefixes and suffixes
- Deploy remediation policies to ensure consistent log collection across your environment

## Integration with Other Modules

This module is designed to work seamlessly with other CrowdStrike modules:
- Use with the service-principal module to grant the necessary permissions for log access
- Combine with the asset-inventory module for comprehensive cloud security monitoring
