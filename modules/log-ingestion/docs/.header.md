## Introduction

This Terraform module deploys the required Azure resources to enable CrowdStrike's Real-time Visibility feature in Azure environments. It configures log ingestion for Azure Activity Logs and Microsoft Entra ID logs via Event Hubs.

## Prerequisites

Before using this module, ensure you have:

1. Azure credentials with sufficient permissions to create Event Hub resources and configure diagnostic settings
2. A CrowdStrike service principal (can be created using the service-principal module)
3. A resource group where the Event Hub resources will be deployed
4. Subscription IDs or management group IDs to monitor

## Implementation Notes

This module performs several key actions:
- Creates Event Hub resources for collecting Azure Activity Logs and Microsoft Entra ID logs
- Configures diagnostic settings to send logs to the Event Hubs
- Assigns necessary permissions for the CrowdStrike service principal to access the logs

The module supports two main log types:
1. **Azure Activity Logs** - Administrative, security, service health, alert, recommendation, policy, autoscale, and resource health logs
2. **Microsoft Entra ID Logs** - Audit logs, sign-in logs, non-interactive user sign-in logs, service principal sign-in logs, managed identity sign-in logs, and ADFS sign-in logs

## Flexibility Options

This module offers flexibility in deployment:
- Use existing Event Hub resources or create new ones
- Monitor specific subscriptions or entire management groups
- Enable or disable Activity Log and Microsoft Entra ID log collection independently
- Customize resource naming with prefixes and suffixes
- Configure network security with IP allowlisting for CrowdStrike services

## Integration with Other Modules

This module is designed to work seamlessly with other CrowdStrike modules:
- Use with the service-principal module to grant the necessary permissions for log access
- Combine with the asset-inventory module for comprehensive cloud security monitoring
