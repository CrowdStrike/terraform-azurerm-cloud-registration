## Introduction

This Terraform module enables registration and configuration of Azure accounts with CrowdStrike's Falcon Cloud Security. It provides a comprehensive solution for integrating Azure environments with CrowdStrike's cloud security services, including service principal creation, asset inventory configuration, and real-time visibility through log ingestion.

Key features:
- Service Principal creation with Microsoft Graph permissions
- Asset Inventory configuration for both subscription and management group scopes
- Real-time visibility with log ingestion (Activity Logs and Entra ID logs)
- Automatic discovery of active subscriptions within management groups

## Pre-requisites
### Generate API Keys

CrowdStrike API keys are required to use this module. It is highly recommended that you create a dedicated API client with only the required scopes.

1. In the CrowdStrike console, navigate to **Support and resources** > **API Clients & Keys**. Click **Add new API Client**.
2. Add the required scopes for your deployment:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Option</th>
        <th>Scope Name</th>
        <th>Permission</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Automated account registration</td>
        <td>CSPM registration</td>
        <td><strong>Read</strong> and <strong>Write</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Cloud security Azure registration</td>
        <td><strong>Read</strong> and <strong>Write</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>

3. Click **Add** to create the API client. The next screen will display the API **CLIENT ID**, **SECRET**, and **BASE URL**. You will need all three for the next step.
